# Serpent Saga: Python Edition üêçüéÆ

## Introduction

Welcome to **Serpent Saga: Python Edition**! This classic Snake game, developed using Python and the Pygame library, invites you to master the art of slithering. Whether you're a beginner keen on game development or an experienced coder looking for a nostalgic challenge, this game is designed to be both fun and a great learning experience.

**Note:** This game is designed for desktop play and is not optimized for mobile devices.

## üéØ Motive

The goal of **Serpent Saga** is to create a timeless Snake game utilizing Python and Pygame. This project serves as an excellent opportunity to practice object-oriented programming, game development principles, and the integration of external libraries for graphics and user input.

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay

When you run the game, you‚Äôll navigate a snake that grows longer with each apple it consumes. The snake moves in four directions: up, down, left, and right. The game ends if the snake collides with itself. Key features include:

- **Scoring System**: Keep track of your achievements.
- **Timer**: Challenge yourself to beat the clock.
- **Restart/Exit Options**: Start a new game or exit after a game over.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core language for developing game logic and functionality.
- **Pygame**: A library for creating video games with graphics and sound.
- **Flask**: A web framework for handling server-side operations, such as hosting and managing web-based interactions.
- **HTML**: Used for structuring any web-based components (if applicable in your development environment).
- **CSS**: For styling any web-based components or interfaces.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic behavior in web-based components (if applicable).

### Key Functionality with Pygame and Flask

- **Graphics and Rendering**: Handled by Pygame's `pygame.display.set_mode()` and other rendering functions.
- **User Input**: Managed using `pygame.event.get()` and `pygame.key.get_pressed()`.
- **Game Timing**: Controlled with `pygame.time.Clock()` for consistent frame rates.
- **Server-Side Operations**: Managed by Flask to support web-based interactions and hosting.

## üì¶ Special Modules and Functions

### Modules Used

- **Pygame**: Essential for game development, handling graphics and sound.
  - `pygame.init()`: Initializes all Pygame modules.
  - `pygame.display.set_mode()`: Sets up the game window.
  - `pygame.font.Font()`: Loads fonts for text rendering.
  - `pygame.time.Clock()`: Tracks time.
- **Flask**: Manages server-side operations.
- **Sys**: Manages interpreter variables and functions.
  - `sys.exit()`: Terminates the program.
- **Os**: Handles file system operations.
- **Random**: Generates random numbers.
  - `random.randint()`: Random integers.
  - `random.uniform()`: Random floats.
- **Math**: Provides mathematical functions.
  - `math.sqrt()`: Computes square roots.
  - `math.cos()`, `math.sin()`: Trigonometric functions.
